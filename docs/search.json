    "text": "1 Introduction\nThis book describes efforts to understand how changing climate (temperature and flow regimes) and dam management practices affect population productivity of Yellowstone cutthroat trout (YCT) in the upper Snake River watershed, Wyoming, USA. We use a Ricker stock-recruitment model fit to long-term redd count data from 13 spring creek spawning populations that migrate between natal spring creeks for spawning and the mainstem Snake River for rearing. All redd count data were collected by the Wyoming Game and Fish Department Jackson Fisheries Management Team.\nThis information is preliminary or provisional and is subject to revision.
